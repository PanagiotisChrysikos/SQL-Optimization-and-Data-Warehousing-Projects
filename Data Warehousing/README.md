# This project focuses on structuring and analyzing accident data using SQL.
A relational database schema was designed and implemented to organize the data efficiently, with a star
schema used to facilitate detailed queries and analysis. Raw data was imported into the 
database and processed to enable meaningful insights. Various SQL queries were developed 
to explore trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.
